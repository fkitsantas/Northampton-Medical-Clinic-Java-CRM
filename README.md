## About the Project

The Northampton Medical Clinic Java CRM is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system developed specifically for the Northampton Medical Clinic. This project was built using Object-Oriented Java and implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The system provides an admin interface for reception staff with the username 'admin' and password '123'.

## Technical Stack

This project is developed in Java, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The main class of the application initializes the `LoginModel`, `LoginController`, and `LoginView` classes, indicating a clear separation of concerns between the model, view, and controller components of the application.

## Features

- **Staff Management**: The application provides a way for managing staff records. Admin users can create, edit, and remove staff accounts, each with a unique username and password.

- **Nurse Management**: Similarly, nurse records can be managed through the application. This involves adding new nurses, updating information of existing nurses, or removing nurses from the system.

- **Patient Management**: The application allows for detailed patient management. Patient records, including relevant medical and contact information, can be added, updated, or removed as necessary.

- **Appointment Management**: The system supports comprehensive appointment management. Appointments can be set, updated, or cancelled, allowing for efficient scheduling and rescheduling.
